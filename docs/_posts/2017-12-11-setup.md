# Docker

[Docker](https://docker.com) is great for experiments with software development. It helps to isolate our project from environment.
As a result, we will have ability to simple share, deploy and transmit our work.

Let's install Docker!

Installation Docker for Mac is pretty easy. Just download and install [https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)

After installation you can run command `docker run hello-world` to verify that Docker is working as expected.

# Docker images and containers

Now we need to create new docker image for our project. We will use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). It bundled with `docker` for Mac version.

Next steps:

- Add `Dockerfile`
- Add `docker-compose.yml`

Dockerfile

```
FROM python:3.6-slim

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install --yes supervisor \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*

ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

docker-compose.yml

```
version: '3'
services:
  chat:
    build:
      context: ./
    ports:
      - '7777:7777'
    volumes:
      - .:/app
```

Try to execute command `docker-compose up`.

You will see something like this:

```
▶ docker-compose up
Building chat
Step 1/4 : FROM python:3.6-slim
 ---> a79297999298
Step 2/4 : RUN apt-get update     && apt-get install --yes supervisor     && apt-get clean     && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 1919b89e84ad
Step 3/4 : ADD . /app
 ---> 5b6bb9cb8341
Step 4/4 : WORKDIR /app
 ---> 88a747595cfa
Removing intermediate container 42fe6e2bae92
Successfully built 88a747595cfa
Successfully tagged chtt_chat:latest
WARNING: Image for service chat was built because it did not already exist. To rebuild this image you must use `docker-compose build` or `docker-compose up --build`.
Recreating chtt_chat_1 ...
Recreating chtt_chat_1 ... done
Attaching to chtt_chat_1
chtt_chat_1 exited with code 0
```

And next attempt:

```
▶ docker-compose up
Starting chtt_chat_1 ...
Starting chtt_chat_1 ... done
Attaching to chtt_chat_1
chtt_chat_1 exited with code 0
```

It means that our image `chtt_chat` was built successfully.

```
▶ docker images | grep chtt
chtt_chat                 latest              88a747595cfa        5 minutes ago       346MB
```

So, first lesson is finished, thank you!
